# Summary

Primordial black holes (PBHs) are black holes generated in the early universe without experience of the form of a star.
It has been pointed out that PBHs may be candidates for black holes and compact objects of various masses in the universe
or a major component of dark matter. 
In particular, PBHs have been attracting much attention in the recent development of gravitational wave observation. 
In the standard formation process, PBHs are formed from super-horizon primordial fluctuations with non-linearly large initial amplitude.
In order to follow the whole non-linear gravitational dynamics, one has to rely on numerical relativity solving Einstein equations.
`COSMOS` [@Yoo:2013yea; @Okawa:2014nda] and `COSMOS-S` [@Yoo:2021fxs] provide simple tools for the simulation of PBH formation. 
`COSMOS` and `COSMOS-S` are C++ packages for solving Einstein equations in 3+1 dimensions and spherical symmetry (1+1 dimensions), respectively. 
It was originally translated from SACRA code [@Yamamoto:2008js] into C++ and has been developed specialized for PBH formation. 
In this paper, we do not describe all scientific results obtained by using `COSMOS` or `COSMOS-S`. 
The readers who are interested in the past achievments may refer to @Yoo:2013yea; @Okawa:2014nda; @Yoo:2014boa; @Okawa:2014sxa; @Ikeda:2015hqa; @Brito:2015yga; @Brito:2015yfh; @Okawa_2015; @Yoo:2016kzu; @Yoo:2018pda; @Yoo:2021fxs; @Yoo:2024lhp; @Escriva:2024lmm; @Escriva:2024aeo; @Shimada:2024eec [^1]. 

[^1]: In most of the references: @Yoo:2013yea; @Okawa:2014nda; @Yoo:2014boa; @Okawa:2014sxa; @Ikeda:2015hqa; @Brito:2015yga; @Brito:2015yfh; @Okawa_2015; @Yoo:2016kzu; @Yoo:2018pda; @Yoo:2021fxs; @Yoo:2024lhp; @Escriva:2024lmm; @Escriva:2024aeo; @Shimada:2024eec, 
additional functions and packages have been implemented to meet the requirements for individual settings. 
Therefore the results may not be obtained by simply running the public code. 

# Statement of need

In the simulation of PBH formation, since there is a hierarchy between the size of the collapsing region and cosmological expansion scale, an efficient resolution refinement procedure is needed. 
In order to resolve the collapsing region, non-Cartesian scale-up coordinates [@Yoo:2018pda] and a fixed mesh-refinement procedure [@Yoo:2024lhp] are implemented in `COSMOS`. 
The 1+1 dimensional simulation code `COSMOS-S` [@Yoo:2021fxs] is derived from `COSMOS` with the CARTOON method [@Alcubierre:1999ab]. 
To achieve a practically acceptable computational speed, an OpenMP package is used for the parallelization. 
No other packages are required, and the functionality is minimal. 
Therefore it would be easy to use for beginners of numerical relativity. 
A perfect fluid with a linear equation of states and a massless scalar field are implemented as matter fields. 
Once users understand the source code to some extent, the system can be easily extended to various scientifically interesting settings.


# Physical system settings

Einstein equations
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
$$
G_{\mu\nu}=R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}
$$
<!-- \end{equation} -->
are solved, where $G_{\mu\nu}$, $g_{\mu\nu}$, $R_{\mu\nu}$, $R$, $G$, $c$ and $T_{\mu\nu}$
are the Einstein tensor, metric tensor, Ricci tensor, Ricci scalar, Newtonian gravitational constant, speed of light and energy momentum tensor, respectively.
The energy momentum tensor is divided into the fluid and scalar field contributions as follows:
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
$$
T_{\mu\nu}=T^{\rm SC}_{\mu\nu}+T^{\rm FL}_{\mu\nu}
$$
<!-- \end{equation} -->
with
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
$$
T^{\rm SC}_{\mu\nu}=\nabla_\mu\phi\nabla_\nu\phi-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}\nabla^\lambda\phi\nabla_\lambda\phi
$$
<!-- \end{equation} -->
and
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
$$
T^{\rm FL}_{\mu\nu}=(\rho+P)u_\mu u_\nu+Pg_{\mu\nu},
$$
<!-- \end{equation} -->
where $\nabla$, $\phi$, $\rho$, $u_\mu$ and $P$ are the covariant derivative associated with $g_{\mu\nu}$, scalar field, fluid energy density, four-velocity and pressure, respectively. 
The pressure and the energy density are assumed to satisfy the linear equation of state $P=w\rho$ with $w$ being a constant. 
The equations of motion for the scalar field
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
$$
\nabla^\mu\nabla_\mu \phi=0
$$
<!-- \end{equation} -->
and the fluid
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
$$
\nabla^\mu T^{\rm FL}_{\mu\nu}=0
$$
<!-- \end{equation} -->
are also solved.
Readers are asked to refer to standard textbooks of numerical relativity (e.g., @gourgoulhon20123+1; @shibata2016numerical) to learn how to rewrite these equations into a form suitable for numerical integration. 
To solve the fluid equations of motion, we basically follow the scheme discussed in @Kurganov:2000ovy; @Shibata:2005jv. 

As for the initial data, we adopt the long-wavelength growing-mode solutions
up through the next-leading order of the expansion parameter $\epsilon=k/(aH)\ll1$,
where $1/k$ gives the characteristic comoving scale of the inhomogeneity, and $a$ and $H$ are the scale factor and Hubble expansion rate in the reference background universe.
The initial data can be characterized by a function of the spatial coordinates $\vec x$ as the curvature perturbation $\zeta(\vec x)$ for adiabatic fluctuations [@Harada:2015yda; @Yoo:2024lhp; @Yoo:2020lmg] and iso-curvature perturbation $\Upsilon(\vec x)$ for
massless scalar iso-curvature [@Yoo:2021fxs]. 
Since the space is filled with the fluid, the initial fluid distribution can be generated to meet the constraint equations included in the Einstein equations. 
Then, the constraint equations are initially satisfied within the machine's precision. 
Therefore, the constraint equations are not solved by integrating elliptic differential equations. 
This is very different from the standard method to obtain the initial data for spacetimes 
with asymptotically flat vacuum regions. 
This is why elliptic solvers for constraint equations are not included in this package.

# Examples

Several examples are included in the package.
These examples are intended primarily for demonstration and instructional purposes, and thus, the precision is not a primary concern. The resolution has been intentionally kept to a minimum.
In the figures below, the length scale is normalized by the size $L$ of the box for the numerical simulation. 


### COSMOS (3+1 dimensional simulation)

- Evolution of a single-mode perturbation

The evolution of sinusoidal small fluctuation is given as an example, which can be compared with the corresponding linear perturbation (see \autoref{fig:kap}).

![The time evolution of the trace of the extrinsic curvature tr$K$ is compared with the solution of the linear perturbation equation.\label{fig:kap}](kap.pdf){height="6cm"}



- Adiabatic spherically symmetric initial fluctuation

The scalar field is absent in this example. The setting is similar to that in @Yoo:2020lmg.
We also attach the data obtained by solving the Einstein equations until an apparent horizon is found (see \autoref{fig:alp} and \autoref{fig:AH}).

- Spherically symmetric iso-curvature

The setting is similar to that in @Yoo:2021fxs.

### COSMOS-S (spherically symmetric simulation)

- Adiabatic spherically symmetric initial fluctuation

The physical parameter setting is the same as the corresponding example for the 3+1 dimensional simulation. However, 
the resolution is finer in this example of the spherically symmetric 1+1 code.

- Spherically symmetric iso-curvature

The physical parameter setting is the same as the corresponding example for the 3+1 dimensional simulation. However, 
the resolution is finer in this example of the spherically symmetric 1+1 code.

- Type II-B PBH formation

PBH formation from adiabatic fluctuation with extremely large initial amplitude is given as an example. The setting is similar to that in @Uehara:2024yyp. One can find the non-trivial trapping horizon configuration as \autoref{fig:horizon}.
